## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Click a card to flip it and reveal the emoji.
2. Click a second card:
   - ✅ If they match → both disappear.
   - ❌ If they don’t → they flip back after a short delay.
3. Repeat until all **10 pairs** are matched.
4. Check your stats — **fewer moves and less time = better memory!**
