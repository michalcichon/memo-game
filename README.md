## 🧪 Full article

📖 This repository is part of my vibe-coding experiment, where I challenged ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to build a simple memory game. You can read the full write-up — including screenshots, code examples, and a detailed comparison — here:

## ✨ Features

- 🃏 **20 cards (5×4 grid)** – each card hides an emoji face (fruits, vegetables, animals, symbols).
- 🎨 **Clean design** – solid purple backs, white emoji faces, smooth flip animations.
- 🔄 **Responsive layout** – works well on desktop and mobile browsers.
- 📊 **Live stats** – shows moves, matched pairs, and elapsed time.
- 🔁 **Restart button** – reshuffle the board anytime.
- ♿ **Accessible** – cards are keyboard-navigable and use ARIA roles.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Click a card to flip it and reveal the emoji.
2. Click a second card:
   - ✅ If they match → both disappear.
   - ❌ If they don’t → they flip back after a short delay.
3. Repeat until all **10 pairs** are matched.
4. Check your stats — **fewer moves and less time = better memory!**

## 🧠 About This Project

This project was **vibe-coded with ChatGPT 5** — built collaboratively through iterative conversation and debugging, purely for fun and learning. 🎉

---

## 🧠 About the fix

The original implementation was created by ChatGPT and is fully functional, but it contained a few subtle issues — for example, inconsistent card flipping and minor visual glitches.  
The `claude-fix` version shows how Claude approached the same code and improved the final behavior, offering a more polished result with minimal changes.
